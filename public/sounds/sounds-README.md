# Sound Files

This directory contains sound effects used in the application.

## Missing Sound Files
You'll need to add:

1. `transpose.mp3` - A short "click" or "beep" sound played when transposition changes
2. `navigate.mp3` - A short "tap" sound played when navigating between lines

You can:
- Record your own sounds
- Use a sound generator
- Download from a royalty-free source like freesound.org

Recommended characteristics:
- Very short (50-200ms)
- Clear and distinctive
- Low volume (our code already sets volume to 0.2-0.3)

## Usage
These sounds provide audio feedback for blind and low vision users and should be subtle and not intrusive.
