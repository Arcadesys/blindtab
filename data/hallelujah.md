# Hallelujah
Artist: Leonard Cohen
Key: C

[C] I've heard there was a [Am] secret chord
[C] That David played, and it [Am] pleased the Lord
[F] But you don't really [G] care for music, [C] do you? [G]
[C] It goes like this, the [F] fourth, the [G] fifth
[Am] The minor fall, the [F] major lift
[G] The baffled king [E7] composing Halle[Am]lujah

[F] Halle[Am]lujah, Halle[F]lujah
Halle[C]lujah, Halle[G]lu[C]jah
