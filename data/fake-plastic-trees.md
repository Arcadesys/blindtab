# Fake Plastic Trees
Artist: Radiohead

[G] Her green plastic watering can
[Em] For her fake Chinese rubber plant
[C] In the fake plastic earth

[G] That she bought from a rubber man
[D] In a town full of rubber plans
[Am] To get rid of itself

[Em] It wears her out
[G] It wears her out
[Em] It wears her out
[G] It wears her out

[G] She lives with a broken man
