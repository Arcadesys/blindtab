[Em] Today is [G] gonna be the day
[D] That they're [A] gonna throw it back to [Em] you
[G] By now you [D] should've somehow
[A] Realized what you gotta [Em] do
[G] I don't believe that [D] anybody
[A] Feels the way I [Em] do
About you [G] now [D] [A]

[Em] Backbeat, the [G] word is on the street
[D] That the fire in your [A] heart is out
[Em] I'm sure you've [G] heard it all before
[D] But you never really had a [A] doubt
[Em] I don't believe that [G] anybody
[D] Feels the way I [A] do
About you [Em] now [G] [D] [A]
